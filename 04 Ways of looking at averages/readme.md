## (only sketches so far)

* In the previous episode we looked at the probability of rolling a triplet with five dice, and found it to be XX. We will now look at how many equal results you can expect to get when rolling five dice, in some different ways. Let's assume there's a game where you get to move three steps when rolling a triplet, two steps when rolling a pair, and so on.
* There are three or four terms that are good to know about when trying to describe expectations in a single value: mode, (arithmetic) mean/expectation value and median. The mode is the most common value â€“ if you want to find a single typical case, the mode is the one to use. The (arithmetic) mean is the average of all values, which is useful if you want to look at the sum of many cases. This arithmetic mean is closely related to something called _expectation value_. The mean in based on actual measurements and thus may vary, in particular if you have small data sets. The expectation value is the theoretical mean, and you can think of it as the mean based on an infinite amount of measurements.
* Spreadsheet: Getting statistics for the number of equals when rolling five dice.
* Spreadsheet: Getting mode, average and median for the data set.
* Some words on what the results mean: The typical result is a pair, and on average you get to move around 2.14 steps.
* We will have a closer look at these data in the next episode.
