## (only sketches so far)

* We've seen some basic examples of how to calculate probabilities for dice rolls and drawing cards. But these quickly get _very_ complex, even for things that look easy on the surface. What are the chances of rolling a straight with five dice? Of rolling exactly a triplet?
* Instead of calculating probabilities, they can be _estimated_ using something called the Monte Carlo method. This is a fancy word for usig a computer for trying something _a lot_ of times and check how many times it succeeds. The results aren't exact in the way you get with calculations by hand, but they are good enough for practical purposes.
* Example: Using a spreadsheet to find the probability of rolling exactly a triplet with five dice.
