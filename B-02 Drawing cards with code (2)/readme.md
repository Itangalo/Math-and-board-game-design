## (only sketches so far)

In the previous episode we saw some lines of code that can simulate drawing 5 of 60 cards, and checking how often we get exactly 2 of 10 gold coins in the deck. We also saw how we could change these numbers, to get probabilities based on larger decks, more frequent gold coin cards, and more. In this episode we will expand on this to create a more flexible function, by using something called _arguments_ by programmers.

(Note: Don't forget to make a copy of the spreadsheet!)

Spreadsheet: Often when we call functions from a cell, we pass values to the function. We can do that here, too.
Apps Script: This is how you tell the function to expect input values.
Spreadsheet: When using arguments, we can reuse the same function for getting a lot of different data. Let's build a table.
