## (Only sketches so far)

* A lot of mathematics in board games comes down to probabilites. Sometimes simple ones, mostly not.
* This episode will show some basics in calculating probabilities by hand (or with calculators). This is good for understanding some basic concepts, but we won't be doing such calculations later on and you don't have to do the calculations yourself.
* A few words on uniformly distributed probabilities.
* Finding probabilitites of a few simple examples of dice rolls and drawing cards.
* A few words on multiplying individual probabilities for finding probabilities of combined events.
* In the next episode we will look at another way of finding probabilities, which allows much more complex situations without getting crazy.
