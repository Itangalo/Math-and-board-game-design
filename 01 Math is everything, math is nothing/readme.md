# Episode 1: Math is everything, math is nothing

I fail imagining a board game where mathematics does not play a role. Even in games like [Once upon a Time](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1234/once-upon-time-storytelling-card-game) (a storytelling game) the ratio of different types of cards matters, and anytime randomness comes into the picture there is mathematics in the background.

Some games seem to be built more or less from mathematical relations, such as [Set](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1198/set) or [Spot it!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63268/spot-it), but for most games mathematics is rather used for analyzing mechanics and making sure that things are balanced and not broken. Instead of using mathematics you often could – and _should_ – use gut feeling, but that becomes difficult when there are more than a few moving parts involved. Another approach is to use playtesting, but if you have a good grasp of the mathematics in the game you are designing, you can shortcut _a lot_ of playtesting and adjusting – often with better accuracy as far as numbers are concerned.

In this video series will talk about how to use mathematics in a number of ways in board game design. We will look at how to do some calculations, but in the vast majority of cases we will use spreadsheets or JavaScript code to do calculations for us. We will also look at some particular games and see what we can find inside them using our mathematics X-ray machine. There will probably be a lot of other things as well, which I can't predict right now, and you are welcome to add questions or requests at the project page.

One thing that we won't deal with in this video series is how to make great games. Whether a game is great or not depends on the experience you get from playing it, and that's a quesetion that humans – not computers – will have to answer. Mathematics can, however, speed up the development and help you avoid creating games that aren't fun because they are broken or imbalanced.
